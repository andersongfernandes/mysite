                <h3>Developing New Skills</h3>
                <p>With a career spanning since 1996 in the dynamic field of live content production, I've continually
                    evolved and adapted to the industry's demands.</p>
                <p>My journey has taken an exciting turn as an electronic engineer, allowing me to be part of some of
                    the most thrilling projects in recent times.</p>
                <p>In 2018, I discovered my passion for chatbot development. Since that pivotal moment, I've been
                    dedicated to my studies, working towards becoming a developer who can harness the power of incoming
                    messages.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am an enthusiastic student at <a href="https://www.coderhouse.com.br"
                        target="_blank">CoderHouse</a>
                    , with aspirations to pursue a career in data science.</p>
